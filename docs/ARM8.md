# ARMv8 (AArch64) backend

Flapjack can compile Pancake to little-endian ARMv8 (AArch64), using CakeML's
`arm8` target. The backend reuses the whole Pancake-to-labLang compiler at word
width 64 and adds an ARMv8 assembler target.

This is a **parity-first** port. Source-to-assembly output is checked
byte-for-byte against the original CakeML compiler. The ARMv8 L3 machine
semantics and `arm8_encoder_correct` are not ported yet, so the backend has no
end-to-end source-correctness theorem and is not part of the trusted compiler
claim in `docs/SOUNDNESS.md`.

## Code generation

- `Flapjack/Compiler/Encoders/Arm8/Encode.lean` implements the instruction
  encodings used by CakeML's `arm8_ast`: move-wide, add/sub immediate and
  shifted-register, logical immediate and shifted-register, bitfield move,
  extract, shifts, division, multiply-high/add-sub, conditional compare and
  select, add/sub with carry, loads and stores, branches and `ADR`.
  `EncodeBitMask`/`DecodeBitMasks` follow the L3-generated definitions.
- `Flapjack/Compiler/Encoders/Arm8/Target.lean` ports `arm8_ast` and `arm8_enc`
  for the instruction forms CakeML's backend emits. Constants use `MOVZ`,
  `MOVN`, a logical immediate, or four `MOVK`s; out-of-range load/store offsets
  are first added into the temporary register 26; long `Loc` values use `ADR`
  plus four `MOVK`s and an add.
- `Flapjack/Compiler/Encoders/Arm8/Configuration.lean` contains the assembler
  configuration: 32 registers, avoid registers 18/26/31, link register 30,
  `temp = 26`, and CakeML's address/byte/jump/conditional-jump/loc ranges.
- `Flapjack/Compiler/Backend/Arm8Config/` contains `arm8_names` and
  `pancakeArm8BackendConfig`, mirroring the MIPS32 configuration modules.

## Command-line use

`flapjack-compile --target=arm8 SOURCE.pnk` emits a GNU AArch64 assembly file
in CakeML's `export_arm8` frame: the `_ldrel` startup code, FFI stubs,
`cake_clear`/`cake_exit`, the code-buffer markers and the `makesym` lines.
`--hex` and `--sections` use the same compiled tuple. The startup convention is
`ret = F`, `pk = T`, matching CakeML's Pancake ARMv8 export.

## Parity evidence

`Flapjack/Test/Arm8Parity.lean` compiles the sources under
`scripts/arm8/parity/` and compares both the whole assembly text and the
code-byte hex with captured original output:

```sh
cakeml/developers/bin/cake --pancake --target=arm8 < case.pnk > case.cake.S
```

The checked-in `.cake.S` and `.cake.hex` fixtures let `lake test` run without a
local CakeML binary. `scripts/arm8/check-parity.py` regenerates or re-checks the
fixtures when the original compiler is available. During development the same
comparison covered all 244 standalone Pancake programs embedded in
`cakeml/pancake/**/*.sml` (with a synthetic `main` where needed), byte-for-byte
and including the `makesym` symbol lines.

## Theorem status

`Flapjack/Compiler/Encoders/Arm8/TargetProof.lean` ports the structural length
lemmas at the start of `arm8_targetProofScript.sml`
(`length_arm8_encode`, `length_arm8_enc`, `arm8_encode_not_nil`) and the first
semantic helpers: the word64 conjunct of `Decode_EncodeBitMask`, `mul_long`,
and the `length mod 4 = 0` half of `arm8_encoding`. They are not tagged as exact
HOL ports because HOL ranges over the full L3 `arm8$instruction` datatype and
uses HOL word/bitstring carriers, while the Lean encoder is fixed at width 64
with `Nat`/`BitVec` carriers.

The remaining helpers `lsl`, `lsr`, `asr2` and `ror` are stated with HOL's
`bitstring`/FCP rotate operations (`#>>`, `v2w`, `w2v`, `shiftr`), which
Flapjack does not yet have; porting them is a separate library task and does not
need the machine semantics.  `asr` is just HOL's library theorem
`word_asr_n2w` specialized to word64, with no ARM8-specific proof content.

The main theorem, `arm8_encoder_correct`, needs CakeML's ARMv8 L3 machine model
(`HOL/examples/l3-machine-code/arm8/model/arm8Script.sml` and
`step/arm8_stepScript.sml`). That model and its next-state function are not yet
in Flapjack, so the proof port remains future work.

## Closed ARMv8 machine model (new)

The `Flapjack/Compiler/Encoders/Arm8/Machine/` directory adds a small,
closed ARMv8 execution model for exactly the instruction subset that
`arm8_ast` emits (it is **not** a port of the full L3 `arm8Script.sml` model):

- `State.lean`: registers, flags, memory, failure flag, aligned-PC
  well-formedness, and the `target_ok` projection.
- `Decode.lean`: a 32-bit decoder for the emitted instruction forms.
- `Execute.lean`: `execInsn` and `arm8Next`, including ARM `AddWithCarry`,
  condition codes, shifts, bitfield move, and branch PC arithmetic.
- `Target.lean`: the nonempty `HolAsmTarget` record `arm8Target`, using
  `arm8Config` and `arm8Next`.
- `TargetProof.lean`: `arm8EncOk` and the unconditional `targetOk arm8Target`
  (projection consistency), plus `Loc` offset-length monotonicity.
- `ExecuteProof.lean`: one-step execution from a supplied fetched word and
  decoder inverse (`decodeInsn w = some i`); the byte-reassembly lemma is not
  yet kernel-checked.
- `DecodeProof.lean`: the kernel-checked `noOp` decoder inverse only.

The model is deliberately closed: unknown instruction words set `failed`
instead of being interpreted by the full L3 decoder. Consequently these
modules carry no `@[hol]` tags. Only `noOp` has a kernel-checked decoder
inverse; the remaining per-instruction decoder inverses, byte reassembly,
`encoderCorrect`, and the `pan_to_target_compile_semantics` instantiation are
still future work. The parity fixtures remain the executable evidence.
